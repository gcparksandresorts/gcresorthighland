		<h3>Highland Community Impact</h3>
		From the beggining, the Globe-City Resort Highland has put the wants, needs, and requests of our surrounding Highland District community first. We are greatful to be a part of the bustling entertainment capitol and have greatly enjoyed improving the Highland community landscape.
		<p>At its completion, The Adventure Project plans to bring upwards of 200 Million more visitors to the Highland resort area. This influx of tourism will increase foot traffic around Highland, driving the revenue of local community buisnesses. Unlike Disney and other corporate entities, Globe-City Parks and Resorts does not plan to drive guests away from local buisnesses, and will always work with local community partners to ensure Highland is included in our projects.</p>
