	    February is officially here! And boy, did January just go on and on and on and on... <em>Anyways</em>, in honor of the official Month of Love (this year a day longer!), I have gone and compiled an extensive list of some of the most
	    romantic spots here at the Globe-City Resort Highland! Go ahead and bring your significant other, a <em>really good friend</em>, or even your mom, or even your favorite sandwich! No matter the person (or food item), I can guarentee you two will
	    live happily ever after-- given it's in one of these places.

	    <p>
		    <h3>10. Fountain Plaza at City-Shop</h3>
		    Everyone loves to get a little wet on their dates (NOT WHAT YOU'RE THINKING), and what better place then right smack in the middle of a bustling shopping center!<br>
		    Though it may be a little cold this month, delight you and your S.O. in some childish playful fun splashing through the dancing fountains, which contrary to popular belief, is not against the rules (in fact it is encouraged). 
		    <br>After you've had your watery fun, move on to this next item to warm yourselves up!
	    </p>
	    <p>
		    <h3>9. Candela - Candles and More</h3>
		    Now that you're soaking, warm you and your date up with some delightfully smelling candles from Candela at City-Shop! Oh wait... you might have to take them home before they can be lit.. OOPS!
		    <br>Needless to say, this wonderful smelling store is the perfect way to share in the senses with someone you love. 
	    </p>
	    	<p>
		    <h3>8. Merlin's Museum of Curiosities</h3>
		    I'm going to be honest, though I love this little walkthrough attraction, the only reason I listed it here is so you could bring your date in, show them all the crazy magical creatures, and then hit them with "All this wizardry, yet you're the most magical thing in this room." 
		    It's a non-stop trip to LOVEEEEEEEE!
	    </p>
	    <p>
		    <h3>7. Nytz Tavern</h3>
		    Need some liquid courage to make that first move? Why not take your beautiful date to Nytz Tavern at the west-end of City-Shop! Indulge in some smooth alcoholic beverages (if you're of-age of course) and then show-off your Pool skills 
		    at the taverns Pool Tables. Or maybe, challenge your significant other to a Kareokee Battle at the Tavern Stage (Kareokee is only available Wednesdays and Saturdays!)
	    </p>
	    <p>
		    <h3>6. The Ghostbusters Experience</h3>
		    Everyone loves a little competition, so challenge your date to see who is the best Buster in town at <a href='https://gcparksandresorts.github.io/gcresorthighland/attractions/adventure-park/the-ghostbusters-experience'>The Ghostbusters Experience</a> in Adventure Park.
		    <br>Whoever loses has to pay for this next item! And whoever wins owes that person a kiss ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° )
	    </p>
	    <p>
		    <h3>5. Galactic Starway</h3>
		    Take stargazing to a whole new dimension with a round-trip ticket to the <a href='https://gcparksandresorts.github.io/gcresorthighland/attractions/adventure-park/galactic-starway'>Galactic Starway</a> at Adventure Park. 
		     Take a seat in a comfortable and luxurious Volkswagen FutureCar and (if you have the courage) put your arm around your date and sitback for a 10 minute trip through the cosmos. 
		     NO HANKY PANKY! ಥ‿ಥ
	    </p>
	    <p>
		    <h3>4. The Hindsborg Flower Cart</h3>
		    Show your date how pretty they look in your eyes with a delicate rose, or maybe a Tulip, from the Hindsborg Village Flower Cart. A classic and knightly way to show affection. GIRLS AND GAYS LOVE FLOWERS OKAYYY
	    </p>
	    <p>
		    <h3>3. Boardwalk Bumpers</h3>
		    Hit [your date] from the back, with a bumper car! Delight in some romantic playful fun at a classic attraction, for two classic lovers ꒰ღ˘‿˘ற꒱❤⃛
	    </p>
	    <p>
		    <h3>2. Beetle Bug Drift</h3>
		    Tell your date that this is a calm ride with no crazy movement... and then let them be surprised when suddenly you two are flying into eachother in a crazy drift! This ride is perfect for those wanting to get closer to their date, without the courage needed to intiate contact.
		    Don't worry, Beetle Bug drift will practically force your hips together! 
		    
	    </p>
	    <p>
		    <h3>1. Lana's Bench</h3>
		    I won't tell you where this one is, because finding it is part of the fun. Lana's bench is locted somewhere in Adventure Park and is dedicated to the grandmother of Globe-City's founder. It's placed such that any two who sit here will have an amazing view of the adventures thousands of guests enjoy on the daily. 
		    It's a place where two people can connect and come closer to ever as they observe the world around them. It's where I had my first kiss with my now husband. Good luck, lovebirds!
