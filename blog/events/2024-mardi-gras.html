	    Jazz music fills the air. Colorful beads of purple, gold and green scatter the ground. The smell of beignets meets your nose. You know what that means – it’s time for Mardi Gras! 

	    <p>The Spirit of Orleans takes over Globe-City's Adventure Park on this one-day event to commerate Fat Friday! Featuring lively celebrations and music, ornate decorations, and a whole basket of activities, you and your family won't want to miss it! Guests travel from near and far to celebrate the day, and it takes cast members from across the resort to make the festivities a reality.</p>

	    <br><br>

	    <h2>The Mardi Gras Cast Parade</h2>
	    <p>You won't want to miss our favorite part of Mardi Gras: The Cast Member Parade! Line up along The Boulevard and watch as dozens of golf-carts cruise down the street decorated by cast members from each of our departments across Globe-City Parks and Resorts.</p>

	    <div class='container'><img src='https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/fjrot4iyhregefwr251364y7u5hergwte.png'></div>

	    <p>Take it from our director of Parkside Operations, Jacob Bainter: “The cast members here really take the Mardi Gras parade and make it their own,” he said. “I’ll walk the halls, and cast will come up to me and excitedly tell me their plans for their floats. And to see the different teams – from housekeeping, to front desk, to food & beverage and beyond – working on their floats as we approach Mardi Gras, makes me proud to be a cast member here at the Globe-City Resort Highland.”</p>

	    <br><br>

	    <h2>Exclusive Food and Beverage</h2>
	    On this day only, experience the decadent flavors of Fat Tuesday as we bring out some delightful sweats and treats at various locations in Adventure Park. From fresh hand-made beignets to colorful coctails and other treats, endulge yourself in the spirit of Mardi Gras!

	     <div class='container'><img src='https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ask23789478089401.jpg'></div>
	    
	    <p>Whether cast are sprinkling the perfect amount of powdered sugar on a fresh batch of beignets or adding the finishing touches to their teams’ float, one thing remains the same: they are always thinking of the best ways to bring the magic of Mardi Gras to our guests. New this year, guests will be able to take a photo with the floats at the end of the parade and meet with the cast that created each masterpiece. And of course, guests are more than welcome to take home as many Mardi Gras beads as they can catch!  </p>

	    <p>See you at the parade!</p>
