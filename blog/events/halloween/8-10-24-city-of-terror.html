          Sally's Halloween Party is our annual halloween event designed for families and guests of all ages. However, this year the party is about to get alot spookier. Our creative team has been working closely with Attractions and Entertainment to bring to life a brand new and unique Halloween attraction, only for the bravest of trick-or-treaters.
	  <p>CITY OF TERROR will be an additional attraction at this year's <a href='https://gcparksandresorts.github.io/gcresorthighland/events/sallys-halloween-party'>Sally's Spooktacular Halloween Party</a>. Tickets for this event can be purchased with admission to Sally's Halloween Party, or inside the park during the event.</p>

	    <h2>Brief Overview</h2>
	    CITY OF TERROR will be located in the Metropolis area of Adventure Park and will operate during the standard hours of Sally's Halloween Party. However, due to the fireworks, CITY OF TERROR will be closed from 9:45PM to 10:30PM.
	    <p>Inorder to enter the CITY OF TERROR area, guests will need to present specific wristbands indicating they have purchased admission and signed the waiver form. Guests without wristbands will be redirected to the in-park ticket booth.</p>
	    <p>Once inside, guests will be able to freely experience the spooky atmosphere which has taken over Metropolis. This includes a unique audio track featuring music from the Kim Petras <em>Purgatory</em> album complimented by a synced light show throughout the land. The plaza area will also feature a stage with some spooky dancers showing off some terrifying moves. Guests can also hop on <a href='https://gcparksandresorts.github.io/gcresorthighland/attractions/adventure-park/ride-the-beat'>Ride the Beat: Waveriders</a>
	    and purchase event-exclusive food and drink.</p>
	    <p>The ultimate draw of CITY OF TERROR will be the brand new terror-maze located on our backlot. Guests will enter through Metro Park where the Java Jive coffee truck is usually parked. The maze, themed as <em>The Toxic Underground of Metropolis</em>, will feature many frights, sights, and delights designed to terrify even the bravest of adventurers. It will take approximately 5 minutes to walk through.</p>
	    <p>After exiting the maze, guests can either leave the CITY OF TERROR event-area or re-enter Metropolis. However, in order to allow everyone in the park to experience the event, <b>guests will be unable to re-enter CITY OF TERROR after leaving the event</b>. Event Coordinators will cut all wristbands at the event area exit.</p>
