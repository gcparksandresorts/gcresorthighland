		    It's the most magical time of year! Snow has once again began to fall along The Boulevard at Globe-City's Adventure Park as we welcome in the Holiday Season! The beggining of this wonderful season also signals the annual Tree Lighting Ceramony as the humongous Entrance Plaza Christmas Tree ignites the night!
		    <p>This year, the Globe-City Resort would like to honor some very important people, Jacob Painter and Will, credited as two of the most influential people in bringing the Adventure Park idea to life! As a special thanks, the Globe-City Resort has dedicated this year's tree lighting to Jacob and their family for playing an integral role in shaping the renowned resort you experience today.</p>
