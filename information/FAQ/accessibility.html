			<h4>White Canes</h4>
			<p>Many attractions at Adventure Park can accommodate a guest with a white cane or provide a place to store the cane in the ride vehicle. The cane may need to be collapsed on some attractions. On attractions where a cane could become lost due to ride forces and present a potential hazard to other guests, the Attraction Attendant will hold the cane for the guest once he or she is seated. The Attendant will have the white cane available as soon as the attraction vehicle is stopped in the unload area.</p>

		<h3 class='collapsible'>Guests Visiting with Service Animals</h3>
		<div class='content'>
			Trained Service Animals (dogs or mini-horses only) are welcome to the Globe-City Resort Highland. <u>Animals who do not meet the definition of a Service Animal will not be permitted in the park.</u> Service Animals must be harnessed, leashed, or tethered, unless these devices interfere with the Service Animal’s work or the individual’s disability prevents using these devices. In that case, the individual must maintain control of the animal through voice, signal, or other effective controls.
			<p>To help you make an informed decision about your service animal’s safety, each attraction has specific entry and boarding requirements, as well as portable kennels at certain attractions. Relief areas for your service animal are also available at select locations throughout the parks. For more information, please speak with an attendant.</p>
			<h4>Attractions and Animals</h4>
			Unfortunatley, service animals are not permitted on any of our moving attractions. However, all of our rides and shows are equipped with large kennels for your service animal to relax while you ride.
			<p>Emotional Support Animals are not allowed in Adventure Park. MDA-SA card is required for a service animal to enter Adventure Park</p>
